# Benchmark: Palindrome algorithm and the Big(o)-notation

Create the Palindrome algorithm with two version one which iterate all
characters in the string and other which run the half of the string.
The goal is runs the benchmarks to see if the cost of the cpu
performance and memory is the same as O(n) vs O(n/2) when the size of
the string is small and when is huge.
